This is my personal portfolio where you can find out information about me, my academic background, my work experience and expectations regarding my career move and interests in job offers. It also shows my email address to contact me.

This portfolio was done by using HTML, CSS and JS. 

I also used:

- fonts.google.com 
- iconmonstr.com for the LinkedIn and GitHub icons.

It is responsive so that it can be seen when using a desktop computer or mobile phone.
